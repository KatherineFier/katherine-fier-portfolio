            <p>The Boulder Flower Farm is owned by The Fresh Herb Company, an established wholesale flower and herb farm. The owners wanted a new reoccuring revenue stream that required little to no physical labor. This new revenue stream became the Boulder Flower Farm, a high-end wedding venue business. They needed a new brand, website and marketing strategy.</p>

            <p>This project included 5 phases: Research and Branding, Website Build, Marketing Strategy and Implementation, and Customer Experience.</p>

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description"> The first phase of the BFF project was focused on understanding the product (identifying what made the venue unique, and who the target client would be).</p>

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">I completed this by engaging in extensive market research including: interviewing the founders and grower, interfacing with their existing customers, participating in the daily farm operations (delivering wholesale herb and flower orders), researching competing venue spaces, and speaking with vendors who had previously participated in putting on events at the farm.</p>

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">Through this process, I identified five unique selling points, the brand values, and ideal customer.</p>

                                    <h3 class="process-portfolio-title">Phase II: Visual Design</h3>

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">After completing Phase I, it was time to develop the visual brand identity. This phase included three distinct steps: Choosing the Brand Colors and Fonts (aka creating the brand’s Style Guide), Creating the Brand Name and Tagline, Designing the Logo and Favicon.</p>

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description"> Step 1: Given the product (mid to high-end wedding venue), target clientele (engaged 25-35 year old females), and nature of the farm (lots of vibrant floral colors); I intentionally chose a neutral, modern and feminine color palette and fonts.</p> 

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">Keeping with a neutral color palette was important because I wanted the colorful flower-filled photography to take center stage. I didn’t want any brand colors to distract from the photos we would use to showcase the farm’s vibrant, natural beauty.</p> 

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">For the fonts, I chose a feminine Script font (only to be used in the logo), a classic Serif font for headers (a nod to the historical element of the farm) and a Sans Serif (modern and easy to read) for the primary text.</p> 

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">Step 2: Coming up with the brand name, the Boulder Flower Farm, was a seamless process after the extensive research I completed during Phase I.</p> 

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">With the intention to communicate, one, what the product was, and, two, why it was so special - I ideated the name “The Boulder Flower Farm” and the tagline “A True Colorado Venue.”</p> 

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">Step 3: For the Logo and Favicon, I chose Dancing Script (a script font) and Raleway (a sans serif font). I intentionally used the script font as the primary logo font because it felt feminine, beautiful and classic. I also used a little bit of Raleway font in the logo to add a modern edge.</p>  

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">I used the Golden brown color in both the logo and favicon to reflect the luxurious aspect of the brand.</p> 

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">I did not use any illustrations in the logo, but did incorporate “est 1983” to reflect the longevity, and authenticity of the farm (one the USPs identified in Phase I). The date added a classic and  trusted feel to the logo.</p> 


                                    <p class="tools-used">Tools Used: Illustrator, MOO, </p>

                                    <h3>Phase III: Website Design</h3>

                                    <p class="process-portfolio-description">There were four distinct steps to creating the website. First, was identifying the site goals. Next was choosing a website platform. Then was designing the UX and UI.  And, lastly, was completing the Copywriting.


                                    Step 1: As with any effective website, it was crucial to sit down with the team first,  and identify the primary site goal(s). Did we want to sell flowers on the website? Build an email list? Or drive people to our social media? 

                                    Together, we landed on the following primary site goal: for site visitors to inquire about booking the venue through the contact page.

                                    This meant that every decision I made regarding the site layout and the content was to clearly communicate: who and how we can serve and guide site visitors who were our ICA to click the “Contact” button and send an inquiry.


                                    Step 2: Deciding on a website platform

                                    The parent company website was built on Wordpress, which proved to be a poor fit for the company. The owners had difficulty making small, but necessary updates to the site. So the site became outdated quickly. And the company paid an outside agency monthly to update the plugins as necessary and keep the site secure. 

                                    Consequently, the criteria for choosing a platform for the new website was the following: 

                                    <li>

                                        <ol>Must be simple to make copy and images updates</ol>

                                        <ol>No need to manage security issues</ol>

                                        <ol>No need to make technical updates to maintain the functionality of the site</ol>

                                    </li>

                                    Given this criteria and the relatively simple functionality needed to achieve the site goals, I chose to build the site on Squarespace.



                                    Designing the UX & UI:

                                    I needed to create a site that would engage site visitors, peak their interest, and create demand and ultimately an inquiry.

                                    To do this, I was strategic in how I set up the site map, header and footer navigations, flow of each page, and calls to actions. 

                                    The site map included the following pages: Home, Venue, Flowers, Praise, Contact, About, Gallery, Blog, Events, FAQ, Legal, Privacy.

                                    The header navigation was limited to only four pages: Venue, Flowers, Praise, Contact with the Contact page having a different button style to capture the site visitor’s attention. The remaining 8 pages, which were not as critical to achieving the site goal were included in the footer navigation.

                                    The Homepage, which would be the most important and frequently visited page of the site (the digital storefront if you will) was all about communicating What the Brand Is and Who it serves. To achieve this, I relied heavily on strategically placed photography and short, clear copy. 

                                    The first banner images on the homepage as well as the short intro copy clearly communicate What the Brand is and Who it’s for.

                                    Each subsequent Homepage section highlights one of the Unique Selling Propositions identified in Phase I via the Image and Copy, and includes a clear Call-To-Action to drive the site visitor to learn more about the Venue and ultimately send an inquiry.

                                    EXAMPLE HOMEPAGE SCREENSHOT

                                    Designing the UI:

                                    Given the brand values {feminine, high-end (white glove experience), ultimate flexibility/ease)} and keeping the ICA in mind, it was important to keep the UI, clean, modern and feminine. 

                                    The biggest challenge when it came to creating the UI was the photography. The owners had some professional photography, but there were huge gaps in the images needed to effectively showcase the property.

                                    Finding a local photographer (looking at portfolio and getting quotes)

                                    Created shot lists and had photograher come out to the farm and to each of the farmers markets at different times of the year.



                                    Completing the Copywriting: 

                                    As with any website I focused on keeping the copy short, clear, and  conversational. I focused on speaking directly to the ICA - speaking into their needs, hopes and desires (being empathetic and ultimately making the copy about them).

                                    Given that I fall into the demographic of the Ideal Customer, I had a leg up with tone and how to speak the ICA’s language.

                                    The most important and significant challenge for me in writing the copy was to make sure that I integrated the foundational copywriting strategies with the heart and essence of the farm. 

                                    Being thorough with my research in Phase I gave me a well of beautiful first and second hand information to draw on here and weave into the copy.

                                    I think the best example of this is the Meet the Grower page. Check it out to learn more about the grower’s values and why for farming!
