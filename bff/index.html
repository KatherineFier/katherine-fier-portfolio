            <p>The founders of an established wholesale flower and herb farm located in Boulder County, CO wanted a new reccuring revenue stream. This new revenue stream became the Boulder Flower Farm (BFF), a high-end wedding venue business. A new brand, website and marketing strategy was needed.</p>

                                        <h4>Step 1: Choosing the Brand Colors & Fonts</h4>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">Given the product (mid to high-end wedding venue), target clientele (engaged 25-35 year old females), and nature of the farm (lots of vibrant floral colors); I intentionally chose a neutral, modern and feminine color palette and fonts. Keeping with a neutral color palette was important because I wanted the colorful flower-filled photography to take center stage. I did not want the brand colors to distract from the photos we would use to showcase the farm’s vibrant, natural beauty.</p> 

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">For the fonts, I chose a feminine Script font to be used in the logo, a classic Serif font for headers (a nod to the historical element of the farm) and a Sans Serif that would be modern and easy to read for the primary text.</p>

                                        <h4>Step 2: Creating the Brand Name</h4>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">Ideating the brand name, the Boulder Flower Farm, was simple after the extensive research completed during Phase I. With the intention to communicate what the product was, and why it was so special - I came up with the name “The Boulder Flower Farm” and the tagline “A True Colorado Venue.”</p>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">For the Logo and Favicon, I chose Dancing Script (a script font) and Raleway (a sans serif font). I intentionally used the script font as the primary logo font because it felt feminine, beautiful and classic. And I used a bit of Raleway font in the logo to add a modern edge.</p> 

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">I chose the Golden brown color to use in both the logo and favicon in order to reflect the luxurious aspect of the brand. I did not use any illustrations in the logo, but did incorporate “est 1983” to reflect the longevity, and authenticity of the farm (one of  the USPs identified in Phase I). The date also added a classic and trusted feel to the logo.</p>

                                            <p class="process-portfolio-description">The parent company website was built on Wordpress, which was a poor fit for the company. The owners had difficulty making small, but necessary updates to the site. And so the site became outdated quickly. Consequently, the criteria for choosing a platform for the new website was the following: must be simple to make copy and images updates, no need to manage security issues, no need to make technical updates to maintain the functionality of the site.</p>

                                        <h4>Step 3: Designing the UX:</h4>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">To create a website that would engage site visitors, create demand and ultimately an inquiry - I strategically set up the: Site Map, Header and Footer Navigations, flow of each page, and Calls To Actions (CTAs).</p>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">
                                        The Site Map included the following 12 pages: Home, Venue, Flowers, Praise, Contact, About, Gallery, Blog, Events, FAQ, Legal, and Privacy. I limited the Header Navigation to the following four pages: Venue, Flowers, Praise, and Contact. I set up the Header Contact page link to be a button so it would stand out and capture the site visitor’s attention.

                                        The remaining 8 pages listed in the Site Map, were not critical to achieving the site goal and so I included them in the Footer Navigation.</p>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">I focused the Homepage, the most important and frequently visited page of the website, on clearly communicating What BFF Is and Who It Serves. To do this, I strategically placed photography followed by short, clear copy and specific CTAs.</p>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">
                                        The first banner image on the Homepage as well as the short intro copy clearly communicate What BFF is and Who it’s for. Each subsequent Homepage section highlights one of the Unique Selling Propositions identified in Phase I via both the Image and Copy, and includes a clear CTA to drive the site visitor to learn more about the Venue and ultimately send an inquiry.</p>

To achieve this, I focused on incorporating lots of white space and being consistent with when and where I used specific fonts and colors. 

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">The biggest challenge when it came to creating the UI was the photography. The owners had some professional photography, but there were large gaps in the images needed to effectively showcase the property. This required that I create a shot list and find a local photographer to fill in these gaps.</p>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">To write effective website copy, I kept my writing clear, short and  conversational. I focused on speaking directly to BFF's ideal customers addressing their needs, hopes and desires. And then relating these back to BFF and what it uniquely had to offer.</p>

                                        <p class="process-portfolio-description">The most significant challenge for me was integrating foundational copywriting strategies with the heart and essence of the farm.  Due to the research I completed in Phase, I had a well of first and second hand stories to draw on. And so I focused on weaving these into different parts of the website. A good example of integrating effective copywriting principles with the essence of the farm is the Meet the Grower page.

Wedding Pro (the parent company) estimated significant traffic to our listings, and one booking would pay back the investment.

                                            Covid hit the month after we signed up. And so many couples were not looking to book venues for the 2020 season. 

                                            BFF booked at 50% capacity the first wedding season, which was also Covid.

                                            I utilized Google search and MOZ.com to create a list of keywords.
                                            
                                            For on-page SEO, I focused on integrating these keywords into the BFF website copy and URLs.


                                            For off-page SEO, I focused on link building with relevant external sites such as venue directories, and local event planners. I also created and maintained a Google My Business account.</p>

Instead of going for quantity of followers and frequency of posts, I built the account slowly and intentionally as a virtual gallery, storefront and business card. This strategy proved to be a powerful networking tool for building brand/business partnerships.
